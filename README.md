## Project Description
### Overview
The Online Library Management Application is a comprehensive system designed to facilitate the rental, review, and management of books through a user-friendly interface. The application supports three primary roles: Users, Moderators, and Admins.

### Features
- **User Interface**:
    - **Browse and Filter**: Users can browse books, filter them by categories, authors, publications, etc.
    - **Rent Books**: Users can rent books for a specified duration.
    - **Review and Like**: Users can like and review books.
    - **Moderator Application**: Users can apply to become moderators.

- **Moderator Interface**:
    - **Book Management**: Moderators can list and manage books, track their availability, and send notifications when leases expire.
    - **Approval Process**: Moderators submit books for admin approval before they become available to users.

- **Admin Role**:
    - **Approval**: Admins approve books submitted by moderators, ensuring quality and compliance.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**:
    - **Django and Python**: Chosen for their robustness, scalability, and the extensive online resources available for development support. Django's built-in admin interface simplifies administrative tasks, making it an ideal choice for managing complex database operations and user roles.
- **Frontend**:
    - **Webflow**: Utilized to streamline the design-to-production process, allowing for rapid prototyping and a polished user interface. Webflow's visual editor makes it easy to create responsive designs without extensive front-end coding.

### Challenges faced
- **Backend-Frontend Linkage**: Integrating the backend and frontend was challenging, often leading to unexpected display issues and undesired effects on the backend interface.
- **Frontend Difficulties**: Implementing CSS properties efficiently to create a smooth and beautiful UI was a significant challenge for the front-end team.

### Future Features
- **Payment Integration**: We plan to implement a payment feature, allowing users to pay for book rentals seamlessly within the application.

## How to install and run the package
### Prequisites
- **Python 3.9 or higher:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. Our team use Python 3.9 to implement this project.

### System Requirement
Our project will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Online Library Management:

1. Any library user should be able to search books by their title, author, subject category as well by the publication date.
2. Each book will have a unique identification number and other details which will help to physically locate the book.
3. There could be more than one copy of a book, and library users should be able to check-out and reserve any copy.
4. The admin should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library user.
5. There should be a maximum limit (14) on how many days a user can keep a book.
6. The user will receive an email informing them when a book has been approved by the admin to be checked out.

### Use Case Diagram
Our team have four actors in our system:
- Administrator (Admin): The admin is in charge of adding and modifying books, book items, and users. 
- User: The user can search the catalog, as well as checkout, reserve, renew, return a book, leave a review, etc.
- System: The system is responsible for sending notifications about the latest news onsite and update the status of the service that the users are currently using.
- Guest: The guest can access the webpage to view its content such as latest news from the library, the regulation or the FAQ.
